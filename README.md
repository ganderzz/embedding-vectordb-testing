# EmbeddingTesting

Messing with embeddings and vector databases. This is a contrived example to find relative matches between text queries and posts I've writting on my website.

### How to Use

You can either connect to OpenAI directly and use their embeddings API, or use a local embedding model. I'm using LM Studio with `text-embedding-embeddinggemma-300m` from HuggingFace for a local, free embedding model.

Next, you'll need the vector database—I'm using `ChromaDB` (https://www.trychroma.com/) as a local database.
Easiest way to install ChromeDB is through docker: `docker run -p 8000:8000 -v chroma_data:/app/chroma chromadb/chroma:latest`

Finally, run the script using `uv`:
- `uv install`
- `uv run main.py`

### Running the Script

- `uv run main.py populate`: Populates the database with embeddings generated by chunked blog posts (these are chunked by markdown headers)
- `uv run main.py "[whatever query]"`: Embeds your query, then talks to Chroma to find the most similar posts to your query
