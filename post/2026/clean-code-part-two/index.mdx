It's been a few years since I've written about what makes ["Clean Code"](/posts/clean-code).
In the post I went over some basics of writing clean code like using good names and formatting.
Though naming things is one of the [two hardest parts of programming](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html), there is much more to writing quality code then just naming things.
This is why I'm starting a series of posts tackling different areas of writing clean code. 
The goal is to start with semantics and move up to architecture. 

In this post we're looking at if-statements and function structure. 
More specifically, I want to convince you that the following is true: else-statements make your code less readable. 
Throw em' away. Intrigued yet? Alright, let's get started.


## You Don't Need Else Statements

For this whole post we'll use the following Python code based on a real-ish world function you may write.
The function takes a `total_price` of an item, and the `membership_level` of the current user. Then returns a discount
price based on the `membership_level`.

```py
def apply_membership_discount(
    total_price: float, 
    membership_level: str) -> float:
    """Calculates the final price based on user membership tier."""
    
    if membership_level == "Gold":
        discount = 0.20
    elif membership_level == "Silver":
        discount = 0.10
    elif membership_level == "Bronze":
        discount = 0.05
    else:
        discount = 0.0
        
    final_price = total_price * (1 - discount)
    return final_price
```
